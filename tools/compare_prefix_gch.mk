# 1% benchmark build for release/google-cloud-hutter and its descendants.
#
# Builds tools/compare_prefix.cpp against this branch's model objects and links
# a prefix_bench that codes a prefix of the post-WRT stream and reports the
# archive size. It reuses the production makefile's own fast/slow/cold/
# transformer targets, so what it measures is what target93 compiles -- not a
# parallel build that could drift from it.
#
# THREE DELIBERATE DIFFERENCES FROM target93, all so the number is comparable
# to fx2-cmix-transformer-v521's completed 673,799:
#
#   no LTO       -flto=thin measured NOT bit-exact on this project. A run with
#                it is measuring a different archive.
#   no PGO       the committed profile was trained on the pre-port code and
#                currently loses 40 functions to hash mismatches, including
#                Predictor::Predict and Mixer::Mix. Leaving it out keeps the
#                bench from depending on how stale the profile happens to be.
#   fixed ISA    -march=x86-64-v3 -mtune=generic, the baseline every v521
#                measurement used.
#
# BENCH_LTO=1 and BENCH_PGO=1 put them back, for measuring the shipped
# configuration rather than a comparable one.
