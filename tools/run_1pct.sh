#
# There are no arms. This branch compiles one codec, so the only thing to
# measure is that codec. What it prints at the end is an archive size for
# 5,871,388 bytes of the post-WRT stream, against the two completed reference
# numbers this project has.
#
#   BRANCH=<ref>   what to build      (default release/google-cloud-hutter)
#   LIMIT=<n>      bytes to code      (default 5871388, the full 1%)
#   CPU=<n>        core to pin to     (default 7)
#   CKPT=<n>       checkpoint stride  (default 65536)
#   BENCH_LTO=0    build WITHOUT -flto=thin (default is on, as shipped)
#   BENCH_PGO=0    build WITHOUT the committed profile (default on)
#   BENCH_F16=0    build WITHOUT the LSTM's fp16 shadow dot products
#
# Always builds from `git archive`: an uncommitted edit is reported and
# refused rather than silently measured, or silently not measured. Commit
# first, then run this -- there is no mode that tests uncommitted work.

#   673,813  this branch at f6df4cc with BENCH_F16=0 LTO=0 PGO=0 and no
#            Scr2Match, 4543.5 s -- +14 bytes for 32.5% less time
#   673,793  the same plus Scr2Match as it first landed, silencing every
#            tie. Superseded: agreement-aware ties measured 3 bytes better
#            at 1 MB, and that is the baseline now, so this run is a
#            reference rather than a target.
#   674,399  pristine fxcm v22
#
# Scr2Match is unconditional, so there is nothing to switch. The 1 MB
# ablation that settled its shape, against the same stack without it:
#
#   silencing every tie            -10     the version that measured 673,793
#   speaking when ties agree       -13     <- kept
#   + KMP failure links            -10     different archive, same length
#   + confidence by bit position    -4     actively harmful
#
# Agreement was the whole win. KMP cost a prefix table and kBlobBytes +
# kPatterns of RAM for no byte movement; splitting confidence by bit
# position diluted cells that only about 1% of bytes ever reach. Both gone.
#
# The +14 is the optimization tier itself, not the compiler and not fp16:
# that run had all three off. The transformer's own loss is 0.462182 in
# both, so the drift is in the LSTM/mixer rework, not the transformer.
