REM
REM S1 (the compressor binary) does not scale with input size -- it is a
REM fixed artifact from build_and_construct_comp.sh, same bytes at 1%% or
REM 100%%. This measures S2 (the archive) at 1%% scale AND verifies the
REM round trip, via the same Predictor/Encoder/Decoder the real codec uses.
REM
REM A real S1-based `-e`/self-extract round trip cannot run on a prefix --
REM confirmed directly: article reorder needs the genuine, complete enwik9
REM article set. That is a full-enwik9-only test
REM (tools\run_google_cloud_hutter.sh already does it, hours-to-days). This
REM is the fast WSL alternative for everything short of that.
REM
REM About 100 minutes for the full 1%% (encode + decode, roughly double a
REM plain run_1pct.cmd). Blocks on purpose -- keep this window open.
